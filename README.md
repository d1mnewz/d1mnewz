### Dimko, the community leaderðŸ‘‹

I am leader of local software engineering community @lvivdotnet. This passion incorporates inspiring people by introducing them into the community of other people who professionally are different from them thus there is always a room for learning or mentoring for somebody. The main idea behind is not to only have tech talks which bring practical value (and could be pretty much seen on YouTube) but to have people connect in the community, meaning introduce them to the group projects, have them discuss contraversial topics, collaborate, make new friends, and learn from each other.

And me, as a community leader, is responsible for all my people to feel safe, to have a place to discuss things and to get inspired by me and other members. 

This won't be possible without my:
- strong interpersonal skills
- competence and technological awareness which makes me able to review all the talks coming in
- confidence in what I'm doing because I've got the vision - the vision to not only become better person and professional, but to make other people around me do so as well
- enthusiam which keeps on driving me for ages
- DDD - Drop Delegate Do - the approach for identifying really required things, delegating what's feasible to delegate and doing the most important thing myself, this approach made it not look like a mess
- belief in others
- a couple of beers at the afterparties

From operational POV, I consider my role the following:
- organizing monthly events for ~100ppl by finding the location, negotiating with partners, finding appropriate speakers, deeply reviewing their talks and in the end is running the event itself at the spot 
- running the [website](https://lviv.dotnet.city/)
- running the [FB page](https://www.facebook.com/lvivdotnet)
- running the [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/lvivdotnet)
- running the [Telegram chat](https://t.me/lvivdotnet)
- working with any kind of partners such as Microsoft, JetBrains, OzCode to have the support from them and let more people know about some awesome products they build
- working with any kind of local partners in Ukraine so we can develop local market
- creating full-day conferences such as Global Azure Bootcamp 2017 Lviv, Global Azure Bootcamp 2018 Lviv, Global Azure Bootcamp 2019 Lviv, and, unfortunately, no Global Azure Bootcamp 2020 Lviv since I decided to cancell it in favor of not letting anybody get hurt by the corona thing.
- connecting the communities by involving foreign speakers, creating shared events with other communities

### Dimko, the software engineer

Tinkering with software since 13 years old, so far gone... 
I've been doing anything you can think of - embedded, mobile, web, distributed systems, product, fixed scope, outstuff, outsource, team extension, architecture, consulting. You call it anyhow, I call it problem solving. This is what I do profesionally. 

Nowadays I'm busy dealing with amazing products based on .NET & distributed systems
