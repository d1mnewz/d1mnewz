This is the thing I am really passionate about. 

### Dimko, the software engineer

Tinkering with software since 13 years old, so far gone... 
I've been doing anything you can think of - embedded, mobile, web, distributed systems, product, fixed scope, outstuff, outsource, team extension, architecture, consulting. You call it anyhow, I call it problem solving. This is what I do profesionally. 

Nowadays I'm busy dealing with amazing products based on .NET & distributed systems
